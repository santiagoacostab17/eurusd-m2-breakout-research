# 📊 EURUSD M2 Breakout Pullback Strategy

## 📌 Executive Summary

This repository presents a high-resolution quantitative analysis of a structural breakout-followed-by-pullback strategy on EURUSD, leveraging:

- M2 timeframe for pattern identification  
- M1 timeframe for precise execution  
- Multi-million row dataset (2015–2021)  
- Fully vectorized backtesting pipeline (loop-free, optimized for performance)  

The objective is to rigorously evaluate whether immediate pullbacks after strong breakouts offer a statistically significant edge in ultra-short-term execution.

> **Data Acquisition & Processing:**  
> Raw M1 EURUSD data (2015–2021) was sourced from [Kaggle – Forex EURUSD 1m Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitjha420/forex-eurusd-1m-data-2015-to-2021).  
> Annual CSVs were programmatically ingested, merged, chronologically sorted, and meticulously cleaned to produce a **clean M1 dataset**.  
> Subsequently, 2-minute candles (M2) were generated from the cleaned M1 data, ensuring accurate aggregation and alignment for backtesting.  
> All preprocessing was performed in Python using Visual Studio Code, emphasizing reproducibility, chronological integrity, and completeness.

# 🧠 Strategy Framework

## 📈 Bullish Signal

A bullish pattern is confirmed when:

1. M2[i] closes above the high of M2[i-1]  
2. Candle body dominates wicks (body > upper & lower shadows)  

Execution logic:

- During the first minute of M2[i+1]  
- Enter LONG if price breaks above M2[i] open  
- Trade expires at M2[i+1] close

---

## 📉 Bearish Signal

Symmetric bearish logic:

1. M2[i] closes below the low of M2[i-1]  
2. Candle body dominates shadows  

Execution logic:

- During the first minute of M2[i+1]  
- Enter SHORT if price breaks below M2[i] open  
- Trade expires at M2[i+1] close

# 📈 Backtest Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Patterns Detected | 433,334 |
| Trades Executed | 51,980 |
| Wins | 24,330 |
| Losses | 27,650 |
| Win Rate | 46.81% |

# 📉 Statistical Evaluation

Assuming a typical 85% binary payout:

- Break-even win rate ≈ 54%  
- Strategy win rate = 46.81%  

Expected value per trade:

E = (0.4681 × 0.85) − (0.5319 × 1) ≈ −0.134R per trade

**Conclusion:** Under standard payout assumptions, the naive breakout-followed-by-pullback strategy does not provide a positive expected return.

# 🔎 Insights & Interpretation

- Breakouts frequently exhaust immediate momentum  
- Pullbacks may reflect temporary absorption, not continuation  
- Ultra-short timeframes remain noise-dominated  
- Large-scale testing confirms hypothesis rejection, showcasing quantitative discipline

# 📌 Author Notes

This project exemplifies:

- Advanced statistical reasoning  
- Large-scale financial data wrangling (M1 → M2)  
- Hypothesis-driven backtesting  
- Clear separation of signal detection, data preparation, and execution logic  

In quantitative research, **robust rejection of hypotheses is as valuable as confirming a strategy**, providing actionable insight for future model iterations.
