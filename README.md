# 📊 Data-Driven Trading Strategy Evaluation

## 📌 Executive Summary
This repository presents a **large-scale quantitative analysis of high-frequency EURUSD price data**, focusing on **pattern detection and short-term trend evaluation**.

The goal is to identify statistically significant **price patterns** using high-resolution time-series data (1-minute and 2-minute intervals) and evaluate their predictive reliability.

> **Data Acquisition & Processing:**  
> Raw EURUSD 1-minute data (2015–2021) was sourced from [Kaggle – Forex EURUSD 1m Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitjha420/forex-eurusd-1m-data-2015-to-2021).  
> Data was cleaned, chronologically sorted, deduplicated, and aggregated to 2-minute intervals.  
> All preprocessing was performed in Python using **vectorized operations with Pandas**, emphasizing reproducibility and computational efficiency.

# 🧠 Analysis Framework

## 📈 Pattern Detection

**Upward Pattern (Bullish Equivalent)**

- Current 2-min candle closes above previous high  
- Candle body dominates shadows (body > upper & lower wicks)  
- Detection triggers evaluation of next 2-min interval outcome  

**Downward Pattern (Bearish Equivalent)**

- Current 2-min candle closes below previous low  
- Candle body dominates shadows  
- Detection triggers evaluation of next 2-min interval outcome  

**Execution Logic:** For each detected pattern, the subsequent interval is analyzed to evaluate pattern reliability.

# 📈 Analysis Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Patterns Detected | 433,334 |
| Patterns “Success” | 24,330 |
| Patterns “Failure” | 27,650 |

**Interpretation:**  
- High-frequency price series are **noise-dominated**  
- Short-term patterns may reflect temporary fluctuations rather than lasting trends  
- Vectorized analysis enables efficient evaluation of millions of data points  
- Reproducible workflow separates **data ingestion → preprocessing → pattern detection → evaluation**
