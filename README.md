# 📊 EURUSD M2 Breakout Pullback Strategy

## 📌 Project Overview

This project tests a structural breakout strategy on EURUSD using:

- M2 candles for pattern detection
- M1 candles for execution timing
- Multi-million row dataset
- Fully vectorized backtesting (no loops)

The goal is to evaluate whether a strong breakout followed by a pullback generates a statistical edge in short-term binary-style execution.

# 🧠 Strategy Logic

## 📈 Bullish Setup

A bullish pattern is detected when:

1. M2[i] closes above the high of M2[i-1]
2. The candle body is larger than both upper and lower wicks

If this happens:

- During the first minute of M2[i+1]
- If price breaks above the open of M2[i]
- Enter LONG
- Expiration: close of M2[i+1]

---

## 📉 Bearish Setup

Mirror logic:

1. M2[i] closes below the low of M2[i-1]
2. The candle body is larger than both wicks

If this happens:

- During the first minute of M2[i+1]
- If price breaks below the open of M2[i]
- Enter SHORT
- Expiration: close of M2[i+1]

# 📉 Statistical Expectation

Assuming 85% payout (typical binary structure):

Break-even winrate ≈ 54%

Strategy winrate = **46.81%**

Expected value per trade:

E = (0.4681 × 0.85) − (0.5319 × 1)  
E ≈ −0.134R per trade

Conclusion:

The raw strategy is statistically negative under standard payout conditions.

# 🔎 Interpretation

Although the setup looks structurally strong:

- Breakouts often exhaust short-term momentum
- Pullbacks may represent absorption rather than continuation
- Ultra-short timeframes are noise-dominated

The hypothesis of immediate continuation after structural breakout is not supported by large-scale testing.

# 🎯 Key Takeaways

✔ Large dataset validation (3M+ candles  
✔ 50k+ trades → statistically meaningful  
✔ Clean vectorized implementation  
✔ No overfitting  
✔ Hypothesis rigorously tested  

The absence of edge is itself a valuable quantitative finding.

# 🚀 Next Steps

Possible segmentation improvements:

- Winrate by session (Asia / London / NY)
- Winrate by volatility regime
- Winrate by breakout size percentile
- Trend filter (higher timeframe bias)
- Range compression before breakout

The framework is built to easily test these extensions.

# 📌 Author Notes

This project demonstrates:

- Statistical thinking
- Bias removal awareness
- Large-scale data handling
- Strategy falsification discipline

In quantitative research, rejecting a hypothesis after robust testing is progress.
